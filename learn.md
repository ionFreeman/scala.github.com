## Quick Online Exercises
[Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/) is a series of lessons and exercises created by [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/). It's a great way to get a brief introduction to Scala while testing your knowledge along the way.

## Online Courses from EPFL

The following courses are available for free. They teach you the main features of the Scala language and introduce you
to functional programming. They are published on both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and an EPFL-hosted Open edX
instance at [courseware.epfl.ch](https://courseware.epfl.ch/).

 * Functional Programming in Scala Specialization (on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)).
   The Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses
   material and exercises by either signing up for the specialization or auditing the courses individually. The
   specialization has the following courses.
    * Functional Programming Principles in Scala ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) and
      [Open edX](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+progfun1+2018_T1/about)),
    * Functional Program Design in Scala ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2) and
      [Open edX](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+progfun2+2018_T1/about)),
    * Parallel programming ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1) and
      [Open edX](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+parprog1+2018_T1/about)),
    * Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data) and
      [Open edX](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+scala-spark-big-data+2018-T1/about)),
    * Functional Programming in Scala Capstone ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone) only).

Note : On Coursera there is a paid version available. The only difference between the free and the paid version is that
you get a certificate of completion from Coursera on the paid version. You can learn more about coursera certificates in
[this help document](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate).
